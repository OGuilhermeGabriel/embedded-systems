# Embedded-systems
This is a repository dedicated to my projects in the Embedded Digital Systems course. It includes some projects I completed during the course.

In these projects, I described the hardware using Verilog and synthesized it using Altera Quartus software. The boards I used varied from project to project. Some development boards I used as FPGAs and CPLDs were: Cyclone® IV EP4CE115 and Altera MAX II EPM240.

## 4-bit Comparator [COMPLETED]

Two variables "A" and "B," composed of 4-bit buses are compared bit by bit and their output will generate a signal based on three conditions: A > B, A = B, and A < B.

## 8-states Finit State Machine [COMPLETED]

A basic finite state machine was created with eight states: these are represented by three bits ranging from 000 to 111. The state transition condition is as follows: if the button is pressed: btn = 1, the current state receives a +1 and moves to the next state. If the button is not pressed: btn = 0, the next state will be the current one.

## Tangnano Examples 

Simple examples of Verilog and RTL projects using a Tangnano1k mini FPGA board.
